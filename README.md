# Java_programs

# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java programs, code examples, and practice questions that I worked on during my semester 3. 
The programs cover a variety of topics, including Java basics, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and more.
Additionally, I have used Eclipse IDE and Maven for development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories based on the topic of study. Each directory contains multiple code files that
illustrate different aspects of the topic. Additionally, the `gitignore` file is configured to exclude commonly generated files and
IDE-specific folders.

## Getting Started

To explore the code examples and practice questions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/aanchaltailwal/Java_programs
2. Navigate to the relevant directories to find the Java programs and practice questions you're interested in.
3. Feel free to open the Java files using your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) to explore the code and learn from the examples.
4.
